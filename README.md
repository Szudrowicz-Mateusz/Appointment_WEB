# C# .NET ASP (MVC) site with MSSQL Appointment Project

## A fully functional site written in C#,HTML,JS,CSS it's mainly created for learning purposes.

This is my project that helped me understand MVC model with some features like: adding,editing and removing appointments from DB also logging to account that get you access to look into your profile and change your password.

* Showing Appointments in hours table
* Adding, Editing and Removing Appointments (records in DB)
* Register, Login, Logout and checking data about your account
* Modifying data about your account

## This is how it should look like
